        <p>This is a simple break out game. Use Meta + arrow left and Meta + arrow right keys to control the paddle, and don't let the ball fall. You can edit the text in the demo file to change your 'wall'. Currently this POC only deals with one paragraph. You can get a higher score if you start with a smaller window, but resize is not currently handled after editor.init. Refresh the page to start a new game. Press Play to start.</p>
